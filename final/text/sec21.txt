Set: an unordered collection of objects :021
Elements: objects in the set (aka members of the set). A set is said to contain its elements. :021
Roster Method for Describing Sets: set = {//list of elements in set}. Order is not important :021
Important Sets: \nN = natural numbers\nZ = integers\nZ+ = positive integers\nR = set of real numbers\nR+ = set of positive real numbers\nC = set of complex numbers\nQ = set of rational numbers :021
Set-Builder Notation - Set = {domain | condition}, S = {x | P(x)} :021
Universal Set: denoted by U, the universal set contains everything currently under consideration. It is sometimes implicit or explicitly stated depending on the content. :021
Empty Set: a set with no elements, symbolized as Ø, but {} is also used :021
Set Equality: two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements :021
Subset: a set A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, A⊆ B :021
Proper Subset: if A ⊆ B, but A != B, then A is a proper subset of B, denoted by A ⊂ B :021
Set Cardinality: if there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, then S is finite. Otherwise, it is infinite. The cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by |A|, is the number of distinct elements of A :021
Power Sets: the set of all subsets of a set A, denoted by P(A), is called the power set of A :021
Tuples: ordered n-tuple (a1,a2,a3…,an), 2-tuples are called ordered pairs :021
Cartesian Product: denoted by A × B, it is the set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a set of ordered pairs (a,b) shows a ∈ A and b ∈ B :021
Relation: a subset of the Cartesian product A × B is called a relation from the set A to the set B :021
Truth Sets of Quantifiers: given a predicate P and a domain D, we define the truth set of P to be the set of elements in D for which P(x) is true. The truth set of P(x) is denoted by {x ∈ D | P(x)} :021
