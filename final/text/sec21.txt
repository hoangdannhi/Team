Set: an unordered collection of objects
Elements: objects in the set (aka members of the set). A set is said to contain its elements. 
Roster Method for Describing Sets: set = {list of elements in set}. Order is not important	
Important Sets: [N = natural numbers[Z = integers[Z+ = positive integers[R = set of real numbers[R+ = set [of positive real numbers[C = set of complex numbers[Q = set of rational numbers
Set-Builder Notation - Set = {domain | condition}, S = {x | P(x)}
Universal Set: denoted by U, the universal set contains everything currently under consideration. It is [sometimes implicit or explicitly stated depending on the content. 
Empty Set: a set with no elements, symbolized as Ø, but {} is also used
Set Equality: two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
Subset: a set A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, A⊆ B
Proper Subset: if A ⊆ B, but A != B, then A is a proper subset of B, denoted by A ⊂ B
Set Cardinality: if there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, then S [is finite. Otherwise, it is infinite. The cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by |A|, is the number of [distinct elements of A
Power Sets: the set of all subsets of a set A, denoted by P(A), is called the power set of A
Tuples: ordered n-tuple (a@u2081,a@u2082,...a@u2099), 2-tuples are called ordered pairs
Cartesian Product: denoted by A × B, it is the set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a set of ordered pairs [(a,b) shows a ∈ A and b ∈ B
Relation: a subset of the Cartesian product A × B is called a relation from the set A to the set B
Truth Sets of Quantifiers: given a predicate P and a domain D, we define the truth set of P to be the set [of elements in D for which P(x) is true. The truth set of P(x) is denoted by {x ∈ D | P(x)}
