Graph: (V , E) consists of V , a nonempty set of vertices (or nodes) and E, a set of edges. Each edge has [either one or two vertices associated with it, called its endpoints. 
Infinite Graph: A graph with an infinite vertex set or an infinite number of edges 
Finite Graph: A graph with a finite vertex set and a finite edge set 
Simple Graph: A graph in which each edge connects two different vertices and where no two edges connect the [same pair of vertices 
Multigraphs: Graphs that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices 
Pseudographs: Graphs that may include loops, and possibly multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices [or a vertex to itself
Directed Graph: (or digraph) (V , E) consists of a nonempty set of vertices V and a set of directed edges [(or arcs) E. Each directed edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices. The directed edge associated [with the ordered pair (u, v) is said to start at u and end at v. 
Simple Directed Graph: A directed graph with no loops and no multiple directed edges 
Directed Multigraphs: Directed graphs that may have multiple directed edges from a vertex to a second [(possibly the same) vertex are used to model such networks. 
Mixed Graph:  A graph with both directed and undirected edges 
Social Networks: Graphs that are extensively used to model social structures based on different kinds of [relationships between people or groups of people.
