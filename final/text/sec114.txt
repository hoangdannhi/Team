Spanning Tree: Let G be a simple graph. A spanning tree of G is a subgraph of G that is a tree containing [every vertex of G. 
Backtracking: depth first search. 
Breath-first Search: producing a spanning tree of using a simple graph. a rooted tree will be constructed, [and the underlying undirected graph of this rooted tree forms the spanning tree.
