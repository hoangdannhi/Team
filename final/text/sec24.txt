Sequence: function from a subset of the integers to a set S – notation a@u2099 (term of the sequence)
Geometric Progression: sequence of the form where initial term a and common ratio r are real numbers
Arithmetic Progression: initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers
String: a finite sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet)
Recurrence Relations: {a@u2099} is an equation that expresses a@u2099 in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence (a@u2099@u208B@u2081)
Solution of Recurrence Relations: a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms [satisfy the recurrence relation
Initial Condition of Recurrence Relations: initial conditions for a sequence specify the terms that precede [the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect
Fibonacci Sequence: f@u2080, @u2081, f@u2082,… represented by initial condition f@u2080 = 0, f@u2081 = 1 and recurrence relation of [f@u2099 = f@u2099@u208B@u2081 + f@u2099@u208B@u2082
Closed Formula: the formula for the nth term of the sequence generated by a recurrence relation
Useful Sequences: n^2, n^3, n^4, 2^n, 3^n, n!, f@u2099
Summation: sum of the terms a@u2098, a@u2098@u208A@u2081, …, a@u2099 from the sequence {a@u2099}
Index of Summation: the letter j in the summation notation. It runs through all the integers starting with [its lower limit m and ending with its upper limit n
