Sequence: function from a subset of the integers to a set S – notation an (term of the sequence) 
Geometric Progression: sequence of the form where initial term a and common ratio r are real numbers 
Arithmetic Progression: initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers 
String: a finite sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet) 
Recurrence Relations: {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence (an-1) 
Solution of Recurrence Relations: a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation 
Initial Condition of Recurrence Relations: initial conditions for a sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect 
Fibonacci Sequence: f0, f1, f2,… represented by initial condition f0 = 0, f1 = 1 and recurrence relation of fn = fn-1 + fn-2 
Closed Formula: the formula for the nth term of the sequence generated by a recurrence relation
Useful Sequences: n2, n3, n4, 2n, 3n, n!, fn
Summation: sum of the terms am, am+1, …, an from the sequence {an}
Index of Summation: the letter j in the summation notation. It runs through all the integers starting with its lower limit m and ending with its upper limit n
