Sequence: function from a subset of the integers to a set S – notation an (term of the sequence) :024
Geometric Progression: sequence of the form where initial term a and common ratio r are real numbers :024
Arithmetic Progression: initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers :024
String: a finite sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet) :024
Recurrence Relations: {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence (an-1) :024
Solution of Recurrence Relations: a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation :024
Initial Condition of Recurrence Relations: initial conditions for a sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect :024
Fibonacci Sequence: f0, f1, f2,… represented by initial condition f0 = 0, f1 = 1 and recurrence relation of fn = fn-1 + fn-2 :024
