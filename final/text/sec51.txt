Principle of Mathematical Induction: To prove that P(n) is true for all positive integers n, we complete these steps:[ Basis Step: Show that P(1) is true. [ Inductive Step: Show that P(k) ? P(k+1) is true for all positive integers k. [ To complete the inductive step, assuming the inductive hypothesis that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k, show that must P(k+1) be true.
Number of Subsets of a Finite Set: For an arbitrary nonnegative integer k, every set with k elements has 2^k subset.
