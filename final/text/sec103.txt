Isomorphic: two graphs have exactly the same form, in the sense that there is a one-to-one correspondence between [their vertex sets that preserves edges.  
Adjacency Lists: specify the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph.  
Graph Invariant: two graphs are not isomorphic if we can find a property only one of the two graphs has, but that [is preserved by isomorphism.
