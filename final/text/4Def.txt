Congruence: When the modulo of two integers are equal
Modulus: In modular arithmetic, it is the divisor that, once divided as many times as it can into the divisor, [will result in the remainder of the division
Congruence Class: The set of all integers congruent to an integer a modulo m
Z(m): The set of nonnegative integers less than m
Arithmetic Modulo: Used when performing tasks utilizing the operations +m and @u2022m
Base b Expansion of n: Let b be an integer greater than 1. Then if n is a positive integer, it can be expressed [uniquely in the form [ n = a@u2093b^x + a@u2093@u208b@u2081b^(x-1)+...+a@u2081b+a@u2080 [ Where x is a nonnegative integer, a@u2080, a@u2081, ..., a@u2093 are nonnegative integers less than b, and a@u2093 @u2260 0
Decimal Expansions: base 10 expansion of integers
Binary Expansions: base 2 expansion of integers
Octal Expansions: base 8 expansion of integers
Hexadecimal Expansions: base 16 expansion of integers
Bytes: bit strings of length 8
Primes: Positive integers that have exactly two different positive integer factors
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: Every integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as [the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are written in order of nondecreasing size
Trial Division: A brute-force algorithm that divides some integer n by all primes not exceeding @u221An and [concludes that n is prime if it is not divisible by any of these primes
Euclidean Algorithm: An algorithm that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers by using successive [division to reduce the problem to two smaller integers until one of the integers is zero
Linear Combination: For two integers a and b, there exists integers s and t such that the greatest common [divisor between a and b can be expressed as gcd(a, b) = sa + tb
Extended Euclidean Algorithm: A method of finding the linear combination of two integers@u0027 greatest common [divisor by making a forward pass through the Euclidean algorithm and then making a backward pass through its [steps in order to the integers s and t when constructing the linear combination
Pseudorandom: Numbers generated by systematic methods
Encryption: The process of making a message secret 
Decryption: The process of determining the original message from an encrypted message
