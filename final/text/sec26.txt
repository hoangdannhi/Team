Matrix: a rectangular array of numbers
m × n Matrix: a matrix with m rows and n columns
Square: a matrix with the same number of rows as columns
Equality of Matrices: two matrices are equal if they have the same number of rows and columns and the [corresponding entries in every position are equal
Addition of Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n matrices. The sum of A and B, denoted [by A + B, is the m x n matrix that has a@u1d62@u2C7C + b@u1d62@u2C7C as its (i,j)th element. In other words, A + B = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C + b@u1d62@u2C7C]
Multiplication of Matrices: Let A be an m x k matrix and B be a k x n matrix. The product of A and B, denoted [by AB, is the m x n matrix that has its (i,j)th element equal to the sum of products of the corresponding [elements from the ith row of A and the jth column of B. In other words, if AB = @u005bc@u1d62@u2C7C], then [c@u1d62@u2C7C = a@u1d62@u2081b@u2081@u2C7C + a@u1d62@u2082b@u2082@u2C7C + … + a@u2096@u2C7Cb@u2082@u2C7C
Identity Matrix of Order n: It is the m x n matrix I@u2099 = @u005bδ@u1d62@u2C7C], where δ@u1d62@u2C7C = 1 if i = j and δ@u1d62@u2C7C = 0 if i != j
Powers of Square Matrices: when A is an n x n matrix, we have: A0 = I@u2099 and Ar = AAA...A where A is multiplied [by itself r times
Transposes of Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] be an m x n matrix. The transpose of A, denoted by At, is the n x m [matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A
Symmetric Matrices: a square matrix A is called symmetric if A = At. Thus, A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] is symmetric if [a@u1d62@u2C7C = a@u2C7C@u1d62 for i and j with 1 <= i <=n and i <= j <=n. Square matrices do not change when their rows and [columns are interchanged
Zero-One Matrices: a matrix all of whose entries are either 0 or 1. Algorithms operating on discrete structures [represented by zero-one matrices are based on Boolean arithmetic defined by the following Boolean operations:
Join of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices. The join of A and B [is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry a@u1d62@u2C7C v b@u1d62@u2C7C. The join of A and B is dented by A v B.
Meet of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices. The meet of A and B [is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry a@u1d62@u2C7C ^ b@u1d62@u2C7C. The meet of A and B is denoted by A ^ B
Boolean Product of Zero-One Matrices:  Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices [and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be a k x n zero-one matrix. The Boolean product of A and B, denoted by A ⊙ B, is the m x n [zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry
Boolean Powers of Zero-One Matrices: Let A be a square zero-one matrix and let r be a positive integer. [The rth Boolean power of A is the Boolean product of r factors of A, denoted by A@u005br]. Hence A@u005br] = [A ⊙ A ⊙ … ⊙ A where A is multiplied r times.
