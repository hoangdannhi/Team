Permutations: A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of these objects. An ordered [arrangement of r elements of a set is called an r-permutation.
Combinations: An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection of r elements from the set. Thus, [an r-combination is simply a subset of the set with r elements.
Binomial Coefficient: Binomial[n,k]
Double Counting Proof: A double counting proof uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of an identity [count the same objects, but in different ways.
Bijective Proof: A bijective proof shows that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the [two sides of the identity.
