Isolated: A vertex of degree zero  
Pendant: if and only if a vertex has degree one.  
Complete Graph: a simple graph that contains exactly one edge between each pair of distinct vertices. 
Non Complete Graph: A simple graph for which there is at least one pair of distinct vertex not connected by [an edge  
Bipartite: vertex set V can be partitioned into two disjoint sets V1 and V2 such that every edge in the graph [connects a vertex in V1 and a vertex in V2  
Serial: the algorithms written to solve problems were designed to perform one step at a time  
Parallel Processing: uses computers made up of many separate processors, each with its own memory, helps [overcome the limitations of computers with a single processor.  
Parallel Algorithm: breaks a problem into a number of subproblems that can be solved concurrently, can then [be devised to rapidly solve problems using a computer with multiple processors.  
Hops: a large number of intermediate links for processors to share information.  
Subgraph: When edges and vertices are removed from a graph, without removing endpoints of any remaining edges, [a smaller graph is obtained. 
Edge Contraction: removes an edge e with endpoints u and v and merges u and w into a new single vertex w, and [for each edge with u or v as an endpoint replaces the edge with one with w as endpoint in place of u or v and [with the same second endpoint.  
Union of the Graphs: graph that contains all the vertices and edges of these graphs
