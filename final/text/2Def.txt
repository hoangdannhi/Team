Set: an unordered collection of objects
Elements: objects in the set (aka members of the set). A set is said to contain its elements. 
Roster Method for Describing Sets: set = {list of elements in set}. Order is not important	
Important Sets: [N = natural numbers[Z = integers[Z+ = positive integers[R = set of real numbers[R+ = set [of positive real numbers[C = set of complex numbers[Q = set of rational numbers
Set-Builder Notation - Set = {domain | condition}, S = {x | P(x)}
Universal Set: denoted by U, the universal set contains everything currently under consideration. It is [sometimes implicit or explicitly stated depending on the content. 
Empty Set: a set with no elements, symbolized as Ø, but {} is also used
Set Equality: two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
Subset: a set A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, A⊆ B
Proper Subset: if A ⊆ B, but A != B, then A is a proper subset of B, denoted by A ⊂ B
Set Cardinality: if there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, then S [is finite. Otherwise, it is infinite. The cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by |A|, is the number of [distinct elements of A
Power Sets: the set of all subsets of a set A, denoted by P(A), is called the power set of A
Tuples: ordered n-tuple (a@u2081,a@u2082,...a@u2099), 2-tuples are called ordered pairs
Cartesian Product: denoted by A × B, it is the set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a set of ordered pairs [(a,b) shows a ∈ A and b ∈ B
Relation: a subset of the Cartesian product A × B is called a relation from the set A to the set B
Truth Sets of Quantifiers: given a predicate P and a domain D, we define the truth set of P to be the set [of elements in D for which P(x) is true. The truth set of P(x) is denoted by {x ∈ D | P(x)}
Union: Union of sets A and B is denoted by A U B
Intersection:  A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ^ x ∈ B} – what’s in common between A and B
Complement: If A is a set, then the complement of the A (with respect to U), denoted by Ā is the set U – A
Difference: A and B are sets with respect to U – the difference between them is denoted by A – B – contains [elements of A that are not in B
Inclusion-Exclusion: |A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
Disjoint: two sets are disjoint if their intersection is an empty set (A ∩ B = Ø)
Symmetric Difference: denoted by A (XOR) B
Generalized Unions: the union of a collection of sets is the set that contains those elements that are members [of at least 1 set in the collection
Generalized Intersection: the intersection of a collection of sets is the set that contains those elements [that are members of the sets in the collection
Function: f from A to B, denoted f:A à B, is an assignment of each element of A to exactly one element of B, [can be specified as an explicit statement of the assignment, a formula, or a computer program 
Injections: function f is said to be this if and only if f(a) = f(b), which implies that a = b for all a and [b in the domain of f (an injection if it is one-to-one)
Surjections: function f from A to B is called onto or surjective if and only if for every element b in B, there [is an element a in A with f(a) = b
Bijections: one-to-one correspondence, if it is both one to one and onto (surjective and injective)
Inverse Function: f = bijection from A to B, then the inverse of f (f-1) is the function from B to A defined as
Composition: let f:B→C and g:A→B. The composition of f with g (denoted f ○ g) is the function from A to C defined as
Floor Function: f(x) = @u2308x@u2309 – largest integer less than or equal to x
Ceiling Function: f(x) = @u230Ax@u230B - smallest integer greater than or equal to x
Factorial Function: f:N→Z+, denoted by f(n) = n!, product of the first n positive integer when n is nonnegative
Sequence: function from a subset of the integers to a set S – notation a@u2099 (term of the sequence)
Geometric Progression: sequence of the form where initial term a and common ratio r are real numbers
Arithmetic Progression: initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers
String: a finite sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet)
Recurrence Relations: {a@u2099} is an equation that expresses a@u2099 in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence (a@u2099@u208B@u2081)
Solution of Recurrence Relations: a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms [satisfy the recurrence relation
Initial Condition of Recurrence Relations: initial conditions for a sequence specify the terms that precede [the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect
Fibonacci Sequence: f@u2080, @u2081, f@u2082,… represented by initial condition f@u2080 = 0, f@u2081 = 1 and recurrence relation of [f@u2099 = f@u2099@u208B@u2081 + f@u2099@u208B@u2082
Closed Formula: the formula for the nth term of the sequence generated by a recurrence relation
Useful Sequences: n^2, n^3, n^4, 2^n, 3^n, n!, f@u2099
Summation: sum of the terms a@u2098, a@u2098@u208A@u2081, …, a@u2099 from the sequence {a@u2099}
Index of Summation: the letter j in the summation notation. It runs through all the integers starting with [its lower limit m and ending with its upper limit n
Matrix: a rectangular array of numbers

Addition of Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n matrices. The sum of A and B, denoted [by A + B, is the m x n matrix that has a@u1d62@u2C7C + b@u1d62@u2C7C as its (i,j)th element. In other words, A + B = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C + b@u1d62@u2C7C]
Multiplication of Matrices: Let A be an m x k matrix and B be a k x n matrix. The product of A and B, denoted [by AB, is the m x n matrix that has its (i,j)th element equal to the sum of products of the corresponding [elements from the ith row of A and the jth column of B. In other words, if AB = @u005bc@u1d62@u2C7C], then [c@u1d62@u2C7C = a@u1d62@u2081b@u2081@u2C7C + a@u1d62@u2082b@u2082@u2C7C + … + a@u2096@u2C7Cb@u2082@u2C7C

Transposes of Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] be an m x n matrix. The transpose of A, denoted by At, is the n x m [matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A
Symmetric Matrices: a square matrix A is called symmetric if A = At. Thus, A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] is symmetric if [a@u1d62@u2C7C = a@u2C7C@u1d62 for i and j with 1 <= i <=n and i <= j <=n. Square matrices do not change when their rows and [columns are interchanged
Zero-One Matrices: a matrix all of whose entries are either 0 or 1. Algorithms operating on discrete structures [represented by zero-one matrices are based on Boolean arithmetic defined by the following Boolean operations:
Join of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices. The join of A and B [is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry a@u1d62@u2C7C v b@u1d62@u2C7C. The join of A and B is dented by A v B.
Meet of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices. The meet of A and B [is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry a@u1d62@u2C7C ^ b@u1d62@u2C7C. The meet of A and B is denoted by A ^ B
Boolean Product of Zero-One Matrices:  Let A = @u005ba@u1d62@u2C7C] and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be m x n zero-one matrices [and B = @u005bb@u1d62@u2C7C] be a k x n zero-one matrix. The Boolean product of A and B, denoted by A ⊙ B, is the m x n [zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry
Boolean Powers of Zero-One Matrices: Let A be a square zero-one matrix and let r be a positive integer. [The rth Boolean power of A is the Boolean product of r factors of A, denoted by A@u005br]. Hence A@u005br] = [A ⊙ A ⊙ … ⊙ A where A is multiplied r times.
