Minimum Spanning Tree: a spanning tree so that the sum of the weights of the edges of the tree is minimized.
Prim’s Algorithm: Begin by choosing any edge with smallest weight, putting it into the spanning tree. Successively [add to the tree edges of minimum weight that are incident to a vertex already in the tree, never forming a simple [circuit with those edges already in the tree. Stop when n - 1 edges have been added.  
Kruskal’s Algorithm: choose an edge in the graph with minimum weight. Successively add edges with minimum weight [that do not form a simple circuit with those edges already chosen. Stop after n - 1 edges have been selected.
