Recursively Defined Functions: A recursive or inductive definition of a function consists of two steps: [ Basis Step: Specify the value of the function at zero [ Recursive step: Give a rule for finding its value at an integer from its values at smaller integers
Recursive Definitions of Sets Have Two Parts: The basis step specifies an initial collection of elements. [ The recursive step gives the rules for forming new elements in the set from those already known to be in the set.
String Concatenation: Two strings can be combined via the operation of concatenation. Let Σ be a set of symbols [and Σ* be the set of strings formed from the symbols in Σ. We can define the concatenation of two strings, [denoted by @u2219, recursively as follows. [ Basis step: w @u220A Σ*, then w @u2219 λ= w.  [ Recursive step: If w1 @u220A Σ* and w2 @u220A Σ* and x @u220A Σ, then w1 @u2219 (w2x), = (w1 @u2219 w2)x.
Well-Formed Formulae in Propositional Logic: The set of well-formed formulae in propositional logic involving [T, F, propositional variables, and operators from the set {@u00AC,∧,∨,→,@u2194}. [ Basis step: T, F, and s, where s is a propositional variable, are well-formed formulae. [ Recursive step: If E and F are well-formed formulae, then (@u00ACE),  (E∧ F), (E∨ F), (E→ F), [(E@u2194 F), are well-formed formulae. 
Structural Induction: To prove a property of the elements of a recursively defined set, we use structural induction. [ Basis step: Show that the result holds for all elements specified in the basis step of the recursive definition. [ Recursive step: Show that if the statement is true for each of the elements used to construct new elements [in the recursive step of the definition, the result holds for these new elements.
