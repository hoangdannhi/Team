Binary Relations: A binary relation R from a set A to a set B is a subset R ? A x B. 
Binary Relation on a Set: A binary relation R on a set A is a subset of A x A or a relation from A to A. 
Reflexive Relations: R is reflexive iff(a,a) ? R for every element a ? A. Written symbolically, R is reflexive if and only if ?x[x?U? (x,x) ? R]. 
Symmetric Relations: R is symmetric iff (b,a) ? R whenever (a,b) ? R for all a,b ? A. Written symbolically, R is symmetric if and only if ?x?y[(x,y) ?R? (y,x) ? R] 
Antisymmetric Relations: A relation R on a set A such that for all a,b ? A if (a,b) ? R and (b,a) ? R, then a = b is called antisymmetric. [ Written symbolically, ?x?y[(x,y) ?R? (y,x) ? R ? x= y] 
Transitive Relations: A relation R on a set A is called transitive if whenever (a,b) ? R and (b,c) ? R, then (a,c) ? R, for all a,b,c ? A. Written symbolically, R is transitive if and only if ?x?y?z[(x,y) ?R? (y,z) ? R ? (x,z) ? R] 
Composition: Suppose [ 1) R1 is a relation from a set A to a set B [ 2) R2 is a relation from B to a set C [ Then the composition (or composite) of R2 with R1, is a relation from A to C where if (x,y) is a member of R1 and (y,z) is a member of R2, then (x,z) is a member of R2 ° R1. 
Powers of a Relation: Let R be a binary relation on A. Then the powers R^n of the relation R can be defined inductively by: [ 1) Basis Step: R^1 = R [ 2) Inductive Step: R^(n+1) = R^n ° R
