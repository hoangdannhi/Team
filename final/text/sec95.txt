Equivalence Relations: A relation on a set A is called an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric, [and transitive. Two elements a, and b that are related by an equivalence relation are called equivalent. The [notation a~b is often used to denote that a and b are equivalent elements with respect to a particular [equivalence relation.
Equivalence Classes: Let R be an equivalence relation on a set A. The set of all elements that are related to [an element a of A is called the equivalence class of a. The equivalence class of a with respect to R is [denoted by [a]R.
Partition of a Set: A partition of a set S is a collection of disjoint nonempty subsets of S that have S as [their union. In other words, the collection of subsets Ai, where i ∈ I (where I is an index set), forms a [partition of S if and only if [ Ai ≠ ∅ for i ∈ I, [ Ai ∩ Aj = ∅ when i ≠ j
