Function: f from A to B, denoted f:A à B, is an assignment of each element of A to exactly one element of B, [can be specified as an explicit statement of the assignment, a formula, or a computer program 
Injections: function f is said to be this if and only if f(a) = f(b), which implies that a = b for all a and b [in the domain of f (an injection if it is one-to-one) 
Surjections: function f from A to B is called onto or surjective if and only if for every element b in B, there [is an element a in A with f(a) = b 
Bijections: one-to-one correspondence, if it is both one to one and onto (surjective and injective) 
Inverse Function: f = bijection from A to B, then the inverse of f (f-1) is the function from B to A defined as 
Composition: let f:BàC and g:AàB. The composition of f with g (denoted f ○ g) is the function from A to C defined as 
Floor Function: f(x) = |_x_| – largest integer less than or equal to x 
Ceiling Function: f(x) = |-x-| - smallest integer greater than or equal to x 
Factorial Function: f:NàZ+, denoted by f(n) = n!, product of the first n positive integer when n is nonnegative
