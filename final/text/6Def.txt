Product Rule: A procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. There are n1 ways to do the first task [and n2 ways to do the second task. Then there are n1 × n2 ways to do a procedure.
Sum Rule: If a task can be done either in one of n1 ways or in one of n2, where none of the set of n1 ways is the [same as any of the n2 ways, then there are n1+ n2 ways to do the task.
Subtraction Rule: If a task can be done either in one of n1 ways or in one of n2 ways, then the total number of ways [to do the task is n1+ n2 minus the number of ways to do the task that are common to the two different ways. [ |A ∪ B|= |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
Division Rule: There are n/d ways to do a task if it can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n [ways, and for every way w, exactly d of the n ways corresponds to way w. 
Division Rule in Terms of Sets: If the finite set A is the union of n pairwise disjoint subsets each with d [elements, then n = |A|/d.
Division Rule in Terms of Functions: If f is a function from A to B, where both are finite sets, and for every [value y ∈ B there are exactly d values x ∈ A such that f(x) = y, then |B| = |A|/d.
Tree Diagrams: We can solve many counting problems through the use of tree diagrams, where a branch represents [a possible choice and the leaves represent possible outcomes. 
Pigeonhole Principle: If k is a positive integer and k + 1 objects are placed into k boxes, then at least one box [contains two or more objects.
Generalized Pigeonhole Principle: If N objects are placed into k boxes, then there is at least one box containing [at least ⌈N/k⌉ objects.
Permutations: A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of these objects. An ordered [arrangement of r elements of a set is called an r-permutation.
Combinations: An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection of r elements from the set. Thus, [an r-combination is simply a subset of the set with r elements. 
Binomial Coefficient: Binomial[n,k]
Double Counting Proof: A double counting proof uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of an identity [count the same objects, but in different ways. 
Bijective Proof: A bijective proof shows that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the two [sides of the identity. 
Distinguishable: When objects are different from each other 
Identical: When objects are identical to each other
Distinguishable Boxes: Labeled boxes 
Indistinguishable Boxes: Unlabeled boxes
