Planar: a graph that is drawn in the plane without any edges crossing (where a crossing of edges is the [intersection of the lines or arcs representing them at a point other than their common endpoint). :107
Regions: A planar representation of a graph splits the plane :107
Elementary Subdivision: If a graph is planar, so will be any graph obtained by removing an edge {u, v} and [adding a new vertex w together with edges {u,w} and {w, v}. :107 
Homeomorphic: The graphs G1 = (V1, E1) and G2 = (V2, E2) if they can be obtained from the same graph by a [sequence of elementary subdivisions. :107
