Universal Address System: a vertex v at level n, for n = 1, is labeled x1.x2. . . . .xn, where the unique path [from the root to v goes through the x1st vertex at level 1, the x2nd vertex at level 2, and so on.  
Traversal Algorithms: Procedures for systematically visiting every vertex of an ordered rooted tree.  
Infix Form: To make such expressions unambiguous it is necessary to include parentheses in the in order [traversal whenever we encounter an operation. 
Prefix Form: obtain the prefix form of an expression when we traverse its rooted tree in preorder. 
Polish Notation: expressions written in prefix form.  
Postfix Form: We obtain the postfix form of an expression by traversing its binary tree in postorder.  
Reverse Polish Notation - expressions written in postfix form.
