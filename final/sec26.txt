Index of Summation: the letter j in the summation notation. It runs through all the integers starting with its lower limit m and ending with its upper limit n :024
Matrix: a rectangular array of numbers :026
m × n Matrix: a matrix with m rows and n columns :026
Square: a matrix with the same number of rows as columns :026
Equality of Matrices: two matrices are equal if they have the same number of rows and columns and the corresponding entries in every position are equal :026
Addition of Matrices: Let A = @u005baij] and B = @u005bbij] be m x n matrices. The sum of A and B, denoted by A + B, is the m x n matrix that has aij + bij as its (i,j)th element. In other words, A + B = @u005baij + bij] :026
Multiplication of Matrices: Let A be an m x k matrix and B be a k x n matrix. The product of A and B, denoted by AB, is the m x n matrix that has its (i,j)th element equal to the sum of products of the corresponding elements from the ith row of A and the jth column of B. In other words, if AB = @u005bcij], then cij = ai1b1j + ai2b2j + … + akjb2j :026
Identity Matrix of Order n: It is the m x n matrix In = @u005bδij], where δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i != j :026
Powers of Square Matrices: when A is an n x n matrix, we have: A0 = In and Ar = AAA...A where A is multiplied by itself r times :026
Transposes of Matrices: Let A = @u005baij] be an m x n matrix. The transpose of A, denoted by At, is the n x m matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A :026
Symmetric Matrices: a square matrix A is called symmetric if A = At. Thus, A = @u005baij] is symmetric if aij = aji for i and j with 1 <= i <=n and i <= j <=n. Square matrices do not change when their rows and columns are interchanged :026
Zero-One Matrices: a matrix all of whose entries are either 0 or 1. Algorithms operating on discrete structures represented by zero-one matrices are based on Boolean arithmetic defined by the following Boolean operations:\n   Join of Zero-One Matrices and Meet of Zero-One Matrices :026
Join of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005baij] and B = @u005bbij] be m x n zero-one matrices. The join of A and B is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry aij v bij. The join of A and B is dented by A v B. :026
Meet of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = @u005baij] and B = @u005bbij] be m x n zero-one matrices. The meet of A and B is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry aij ^ bij. The meet of A and B is denoted by A ^ B :026
Boolean Product of Zero-One Matrices:  Let A = @u005baij] and B = @u005bbij] be m x n zero-one matrices and B = @u005bbij] be a k x n zero-one matrix. The Boolean product of A and B, denoted by A ⊙ B, is the m x n zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry :026
Boolean Powers of Zero-One Matrices: Let A be a square zero-one matrix and let r be a positive integer. The rth Boolean power of A is the Boolean product of r factors of A, denoted by A@u005br]. Hence A@u005br] = A ⊙ A ⊙ … ⊙ A where A is multiplied r times. :026
