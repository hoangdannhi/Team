Halting Problems: A well-known computer science problem that is unsolvable. It entails the impossibility of a procedure that can take a computer program as input and input to the program and determine whether the program will eventually stop when run with this input.
Big-O Notation: allows the estimation of growth of functions without needing the consideration of constant multipliers and smaller order terms
Landau Symbol: the name of the big-O symbol, named after the German mathematician Paul Landau
Big-Omega Notation: provides the lower bound for the size of f(x)
Big-Theta Notation: The notation used when providing both the upper bound and lower bound of a function f(x) relative to a reference function g(x)
Computational Complexity: The efficiency of an algorithm based on the amount of time needed based on a specified input size and the size of memory needed to implement it
Time Complexity: An analysis of the time required to solve a problem of a particular size
Space Complexity: An analysis of the computer memory required of an algorithm
Worst-Case: the largest number of operations needed to solve the given problem using this algorithm on input of specified size
