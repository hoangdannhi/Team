Set: an unordered collection of objects
Elements: objects in the set (aka members of the set). A set is said to contain its elements. 
Roster Method for Describing Sets: set = {//list of elements in set}. Order is not important	
Important Sets: \nN = natural numbers\nZ = integers\nZ+ = positive integers\nR = set of real numbers\nR+ = set of positive real numbers\nC = set of complex numbers\nQ = set of rational numbers
Set-Builder Notation - Set = {domain | condition}, S = {x | P(x)}
Universal Set: denoted by U, the universal set contains everything currently under consideration. It is sometimes implicit or explicitly stated depending on the content. 
Empty Set: a set with no elements, symbolized as Ø, but {} is also used
Set Equality: two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
Subset: a set A is a subset of B, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, A⊆ B
Proper Subset: if A ⊆ B, but A != B, then A is a proper subset of B, denoted by A ⊂ B
Set Cardinality: if there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, then S is finite. Otherwise, it is infinite. The cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by |A|, is the number of distinct elements of A
Power Sets: the set of all subsets of a set A, denoted by P(A), is called the power set of A
Tuples: ordered n-tuple (a1,a2,a3…,an), 2-tuples are called ordered pairs
Cartesian Product: denoted by A × B, it is the set of ordered pairs (a, b) where a set of ordered pairs (a,b) shows a ∈ A and b ∈ B
Relation: a subset of the Cartesian product A × B is called a relation from the set A to the set B
Truth Sets of Quantifiers: given a predicate P and a domain D, we define the truth set of P to be the set of elements in D for which P(x) is true. The truth set of P(x) is denoted by {x ∈ D | P(x)}
Union: Union of sets A and B is denoted by A U B
Intersection:  A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ^ x ∈ B} – what’s in common between A and B
Complement: If A is a set, then the complement of the A (with respect to U), denoted by Ā is the set U – A
Difference: A and B are sets with respect to U – the difference between them is denoted by A – B – contains elements of A that are not in B
Inclusion-Exclusion: |A U B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
Disjoint: two sets are disjoint if their intersection is an empty set (A ∩ B = Ø)
Symmetric Difference: denoted by A (XOR) B
Generalized Unions: the union of a collection of sets is the set that contains those elements that are members of at least 1 set in the collection
Generalized Intersection: the intersection of a collection of sets is the set that contains those elements that are members of the sets in the collection
Function: f from A to B, denoted f:A à B, is an assignment of each element of A to exactly one element of B, can be specified as an explicit statement of the assignment, a formula, or a computer program 
Injections: function f is said to be this if and only if f(a) = f(b), which implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f (an injection if it is one-to-one)
Surjections: function f from A to B is called onto or surjective if and only if for every element b in B, there is an element a in A with f(a) = b
Bijections: one-to-one correspondence, if it is both one to one and onto (surjective and injective)
Inverse Function: f = bijection from A to B, then the inverse of f (f-1) is the function from B to A defined as
Composition: let f:BàC and g:AàB. The composition of f with g (denoted f ○ g) is the function from A to C defined as
Floor Function: f(x) = |_x_| – largest integer less than or equal to x
Ceiling Function: f(x) = |-x-| - smallest integer greater than or equal to x
Factorial Function: f:NàZ+, denoted by f(n) = n!, product of the first n positive integer when n is nonnegative
Sequence: function from a subset of the integers to a set S – notation an (term of the sequence)
Geometric Progression: sequence of the form where initial term a and common ratio r are real numbers
Arithmetic Progression: initial term a and the common difference d are real numbers
String: a finite sequence of characters from a finite set (an alphabet)
Recurrence Relations: {an} is an equation that expresses an in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence (an-1)
Solution of Recurrence Relations: a sequence is called a solution of a recurrence relation if its terms satisfy the recurrence relation
Initial Condition of Recurrence Relations: initial conditions for a sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect
Fibonacci Sequence: f0, f1, f2,… represented by initial condition f0 = 0, f1 = 1 and recurrence relation of fn = fn-1 + fn-2
Closed Formula: the formula for the nth term of the sequence generated by a recurrence relation
Useful Sequences: n2, n3, n4, 2n, 3n, n!, fn
Summation: sum of the terms am, am+1, …, an from the sequence {an}
Index of Summation: the letter j in the summation notation. It runs through all the integers starting with its lower limit m and ending with its upper limit n
Matrix: a rectangular array of numbers
m × n Matrix: a matrix with m rows and n columns
Square: a matrix with the same number of rows as columns
Equality of Matrices: two matrices are equal if they have the same number of rows and columns and the corresponding entries in every position are equal
Addition of Matrices: Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] be m x n matrices. The sum of A and B, denoted by A + B, is the m x n matrix that has aij + bij as its (i,j)th element. In other words, A + B = [aij + bij]
Multiplication of Matrices: Let A be an m x k matrix and B be a k x n matrix. The product of A and B, denoted by AB, is the m x n matrix that has its (i,j)th element equal to the sum of products of the corresponding elements from the ith row of A and the jth column of B. In other words, if AB = [cij], then cij = ai1b1j + ai2b2j + … + akjb2j
Identity Matrix of Order n: It is the m x n matrix In = [δij], where δij = 1 if i = j and δij = 0 if i != j
Powers of Square Matrices: when A is an n x n matrix, we have: A0 = In and Ar = AAA...A where A is multiplied by itself r times
Transposes of Matrices: Let A = [aij] be an m x n matrix. The transpose of A, denoted by At, is the n x m matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A
Symmetric Matrices: a square matrix A is called symmetric if A = At. Thus, A = [aij] is symmetric if aij = aji for i and j with 1 <= i <=n and i <= j <=n. Square matrices do not change when their rows and columns are interchanged
Zero-One Matrices: a matrix all of whose entries are either 0 or 1. Algorithms operating on discrete structures represented by zero-one matrices are based on Boolean arithmetic defined by the following Boolean operations:
Join of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] be m x n zero-one matrices. The join of A and B is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry aij v bij. The join of A and B is dented by A v B.
Meet of Zero-One Matrices: Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] be m x n zero-one matrices. The meet of A and B is the zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry aij ^ bij. The meet of A and B is denoted by A ^ B
Boolean Product of Zero-One Matrices:  Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] be m x n zero-one matrices and B = [bij] be a k x n zero-one matrix. The Boolean product of A and B, denoted by A ⊙ B, is the m x n zero-one matrix with (i,j)th entry
Boolean Powers of Zero-One Matrices: Let A be a square zero-one matrix and let r be a positive integer. The rth Boolean power of A is the Boolean product of r factors of A, denoted by A[r]. Hence A[r] = A ⊙ A ⊙ … ⊙ A where A is multiplied r times.
